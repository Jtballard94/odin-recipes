        <h3> what a beautiful cut of meat</h3>
        <p>
            This cut of meat is one of those cuts that goes under the radar. Very popular in brazilian steak houses, but not seen much in the US. I enjoy cooking this cut many different ways,
             but for this post ill keep it as a roast. Look out for more content on how to cook it as steaks. As a roast think tritip, but add more flavor, tenderness and a better fat cap.

        <h2>How to cook the Picanha</h2>
        <p>As I said before there are many ways too cook this cut. today we'll reverse sear it.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Pat your roast dry and add your seasonings</li>
            <li>let it sit as your smoker or oven is getting up to temp</li>
            <li>once the ven is at temp heat a cast iron skillet and coat with butter</li>
            <li>Sear the fat cam first then the rest of the roast, this should just be a quick sear to brown the meat.</li>
            <li>If cooking in the oven you can leave it on the cast iron but i prefer a baking sheet with a cooling rack on it</li>
            <li>Once the roast reaches an internal temp of 135, pull it out and let it rest for at least 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Then slice and enjoy with your favorite sides, maybe some gravy or chimichurri</li>
        </ol>
