        <p> Beef cheek  when cooked right will be one of inf not the best thing to touch your dinner table this year.</p>
        <p>
            These smoked then braised beef cheeks will fall apart by the time you take them out of the smoker. They are a super versatile cut of meat. I almost always
            use mine for tacos, but they also go prefect with mashed potatoes while using the braising liquid as a gravy. Usually the leftovers, if i have any, will go on top of my eggs in the morning.
            Follow this recipe and feel free to tweak it in any way you like. Don't like coffee, don't add it. Don't like spice, don't add it. Want something sweeter, add brown sugar. 
            But most of all enjoy and don't forget to share.
