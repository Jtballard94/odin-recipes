# odin-recipes
#During this project I will be making a basic website to show off my favorite recipes. 
I will be using only html for now. 
During this project I want to demonstrate the knowledge I learned of html. 
I will use headings, unordered lists, ordered lists, links and images to make this website. 
I would like it to look as nice as i can without using CSS.
